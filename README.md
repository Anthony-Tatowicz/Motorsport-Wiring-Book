# Electrical-Harness-Workbooks

Example workbooks for laying out complex wiring harness with many connectors, functions and pins.
See the Motorsport_Wiring_Harness_Construction.pdf for a guide on how to run wires and build connectors.

### General Guide Lines

The general format works quite well for practical harness building, it can be printed and put into a book and also contains the following information for reference.

1. Every connector with a picture and title
2. A connector code for labeling 
3. Every pin number and pin function for all connectors.
4. Color coding for every wire
5. The pin/wire endpoint
6. Recommended AWG
7. Part numbers for the connectors and pins


### Examples

The examples are broken down into two books 
1. F98_Workbook - A simple workbook for a 250CC sport bike engine with an ECU, gauges and basic safety features.
2. F18_Workbook - A more complex workbook for a 600CC sport bike engine with custom electronics systems, CAN buses and servo motor controls.

### Background
The example workbooks were used in the design and development of FSAE cars, they were very handy
when reference was required during manufacturing and troubleshooting. The books are also great 
references for anyone who may need to understand or work on the system in the future with minimal 
setup, software or knowledge. 

### Formats 

1. Original .xlsx spreadsheet format for editing on sheets or excel  
2. HTML format to display in any browser.


### Notes

It's fairly straight forward to modify these for a specific application, as most manufacturers have
product drawings. A few key things to note.

1. The Parts sheet is labeled and handy when doing orders, its good practice to keep it updated. The parts used in these examples are high end automotive grade parts and some are even milspec parts which will be useful for application needing robust parts.
2. The Basic Wire Info sheet is a reference to use when choosing wire sizes for your application, these number are derived from SAE and MIL specs.
3. The Wire Sizes sheet is a specific reference for the application in use, in this application it shows all the basic wire sizes used for various automotive components.
4. The Relay & Fuses Diagram shows a layout to build a relay and fuse block for power distribution. 
5. Every major component is broken down into separate sheets and given a custom label.
